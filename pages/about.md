# HelloÔºÅ

I'm Zhen Fan, a first-year PhD student at Language Technologies Institute (LTI), Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently working with Professor [Jamie Callan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~callan/ "Jamie Callan"), focusing on text retrieval and representation learning with neural networks. 

I finished my 2-year master's program at LTI (2019-2021) prior to the PhD program. I completed my undergraduate studies in China at Tsinghua University, majoring in computer science and technology. 

You can find out more about me and my work in the publication and CV section.
