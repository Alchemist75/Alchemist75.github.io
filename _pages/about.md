####HelloÔºÅ

I'm Zhen Fan, a first-year master student at Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently working with Professor Jamie Callan. Currently my research mainly focuses on neural IR.

Before coming to CMU, I completed my undergraduate studies in Tsinghua University(China), majoring in computer science and technology.
